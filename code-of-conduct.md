- Threats of violence, both physical and psychological

- Deliberate intimidation

- Sustained disruption of discussion

- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease

- Publication of non-harassing private communication

## **Moderation**
- Chat room moderators volunteer their time to help keep the room running smoothly and are responsible for managing often complex situations

- Moderators are given exclusive privileges to help maximise the effectiveness of the room

- If you are asked to modify your behaviour or given some other form of instruction but fail to comply, you are likely to be removed from the chat room for a discretionary period of time depending on the severity of the matter

- When being corrected by a moderator, please do not argue with them in main chat. You should request a PM session to help avoid conflict and keep the involvement of others to a minimum

- Attacking moderators in the chat room will likely result in a ban. Any genuine visitor should respect their decisions - they have nothing to gain from issuing bans / mutes and are doing so to the best of their ability, on behalf of the community

- Moderators may choose to request users to leave if they're deemed to be a risk to the safety of the general users / guests within the chatroom. Not adhering to the request will result in manual removal

- An appeal can be requested but is to the discretion of the moderator who issued that ban / mute - however, this is not a given right. To make an appeal, please PM the respective moderator

- You are welcome to return to the chat room once your ban period expires, but please be mindful of the reason(s) you got banned, abide by the rules and take into account any moderator feedback received.

- If a ban is evaded within the designated period (for any reason), please note that our moderators may extend the ban beyond the original lapse date.

### Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour — or have any other concerns — please report in Matrix or by contacting us via abuse@hackliberty.org. All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:

- Your contact information.
- Names (usernames and/or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing.
- The date and time of the incident (or start of incident).
- Any additional information that may be helpful.

After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.
